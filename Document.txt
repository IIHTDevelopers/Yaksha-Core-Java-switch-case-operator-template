Project Overview:
This project focuses on evaluating the participants' ability to implement decision-making logic using the switch-case statement in Java. The switch-case statement allows for cleaner and more readable code compared to multiple if-else-if statements. This document presents the tasks, Java code for implementation, and a test case class to evaluate the use of the switch-case statement.

Learning Objectives:
By the end of this project, participants will be able to:

Use the switch-case statement for conditional decisions.
Replace if-else-if statements with switch-case for more compact and readable code.
Solve problems using switch-case statements instead of traditional conditional structures.
Assessment Tasks:
Task 1: Day of the Week

Write a program that checks the name of the day based on the given integer (1 to 7), using the switch-case statement.
Example:

Input: day = 3
Output: "Wednesday"
Task 2: Number of Days in a Month

Write a program that returns the number of days in a month, based on the given month number (1 to 12), using the switch-case statement.
Example:

Input: month = 2
Output: "28 or 29 days"
Task 3: Check Grade Based on Marks

Write a program that assigns a grade based on the given marks using the switch-case statement.
A: 90 to 100
B: 75 to 89
C: 50 to 74
F: Below 50
Example:

Input: marks = 82
Output: "Grade: B"
Task 4: Month Name

Write a program that prints the month name based on the month number (1 to 12) using the switch-case statement.
Example:

Input: month = 5
Output: "May"
Task 5: Calculate the Season

Write a program that checks the season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) based on the month number using the switch-case statement.
Example:

Input: month = 12
Output: "Winter"
